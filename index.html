		<div id="intro">
			<p>The goal of Magic: The Gathering is to get your opponent to zero life. Each player starts the game with 20 life.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="draw">
			<p>The game begins with each player drawing 7 cards. Click on the deck to draw.</p>
			<div id="deck"><img src="./img/card_back.jpg" /></div>
			<div id="hand"></div>
		</div>
		<div id="creature_spells">
			<p id="landDescr">You can play one land per turn. Click on a land to place it on the battlefield.</p>
			<p id="costDescr">Lands are used to pay the mana cost of all non-land cards. The mana cost of a card can be found in the upper right hand corner of the card. 
			   A card with the mana cost <img src="./img/mana_f.png" class="cost"/> requires one forest.
			   A card with the mana cost <img src="./img/mana.svg"/ class="cost"><img src="./img/mana_f.png" class="cost"/> requires one mana of any color plus one forest.
			   To play a card, pay the mana cost by tapping the correct number of lands on the battlefield. Click on a land to tap it. Then play a card from your hand by clicking on it.</p>	
			<div id="summonDescr">
				<p>A creature cannot attack or use abilities the turn it is played, so there is nothing else you can do on this turn. 
				After your turn ends, your opponent would then take their first turn. Your tapped land would remain tapped during their turn. 
				If you had additional tapped lands or creatures on the battlefield, those would also all stay tapped during your opponent's turn. 
				Tapped lands cannot be used to cast spells, and tapped creatures cannot be used to block against attacks.</p>
				<p>Click <span id="pass">here</span> to begin your second turn. Your turn always begins by untapping all of your tapped lands and creatures.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="turn2">
				<p>Always draw a card at the beginning of your turn, right after everything untaps. Click on the deck to draw a card.</p>
				<p>Next, play a land. Then choose another creature to cast from your hand. Remember to pay its mana cost by tapping the correct number of lands.
