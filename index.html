		<div id="intro">
			<p>In Magic: The Gathering, players cast creatures and other spells to attack and defend against their opponent. Each player starts the game with 20 life, and you win by getting your opponent to 0 life.</p>
			<p>MTG Tutor is an interactive tool that teaches the basic rules of Magic: the Gathering. MTG Tutor covers how to cast creature spells, other spells, and combat. 
			It should take about 10 minutes to play through MTG Tutor.</p>

				<h2>Creature Spells</h2>
				<p>The game begins with each player drawing 7 cards. Click on the deck to draw.</p>
				<div id="deck"><img src="./img/card_back.jpg" /></div>
				<div id="hand"></div>
			</div>
			<p id="landDescr">You can play one land per turn. Click on a land to place it on the battlefield.</p>
			<p id="costDescr">Lands are used to pay the mana cost of all non-land cards. The mana cost of a card can be found in the upper right hand corner of the card. 
			   A card with the mana cost <img src="./img/mana_f.png" class="cost"/> requires one forest.
			   A card with the mana cost <img src="./img/mana.svg"/ class="cost"><img src="./img/mana_f.png" class="cost"/> requires one mana of any color plus one forest.
			   To play a card, pay the mana cost by tapping the correct number of lands on the battlefield. Click on a land to tap it. Then play a card from your hand by clicking on it.</p>	
			<div id="summonDescr">
				<p>A creature cannot attack or use abilities the turn it is played, so there is nothing else you can do on this turn. 
				After your turn ends, your opponent would then take their first turn. Your tapped land would remain tapped during their turn. 
				If you had additional tapped lands or creatures on the battlefield, those would also all stay tapped during your opponent's turn. 
				Tapped lands cannot be used to cast spells, and tapped creatures cannot be used to block against attacks.</p>
				<p>Click <span id="pass">here</span> to begin your second turn. Your turn always begins by untapping all of your tapped lands and creatures.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="turn2">
				<p>Always draw a card at the beginning of your turn, right after everything untaps. Click on the deck to draw a card.</p>
				<p>Next, play a land. Then choose another creature to cast from your hand. Remember to pay its mana cost by tapping the correct number of lands.

					<p>There are other types of spells besides creatures. The main types are instants, sorceries, enchantments, and artifacts.
					Instants can be played at any time during the game, even during your opponent's turn, as long as you can pay the mana cost.
					You can only play sorceries, enchantments, and artifacts during your turn.</p>

					<h2>The Stack</h2>
					<div id="stackDescr">
						<div id="grey1"><p>Whenever a player casts a spell, that spell doesn't happen (resolve) immediately. Instead, the spell is added to "the stack." 
						If the other player casts a spell in response, the new spell is added to the stack on top of the previous spell. When both players 
						are done casting spells, the spells on the stack resolve starting with the spell on top of the stack. So, the spell that was 
						played most recently resolves first.</p>
						<p>Say your opponent plays Doom Blade targeting your Runeclaw Bear while you have Blossoming Defense in your hand. In response, 
						you can tap one forest to play Blossoming Defense and add it to the stack on top of Doom Blade to save your bear. Blossoming Defense 
						resolves first and gives Runeclaw Bear hexproof, which means that Runeclaw Bear can no longer be targeted by Doom Blade.</p>
						<p>Click on Doom Blade to have your opponent add it to the stack.</p></div>
						<div id="grey2"><p>Tap one forest to pay the mana cost for Blossoming Defense, then click on Blossoming Defense to add it to the stack.</p></div>
						<div style="display: block"><div id="grey3">Click <div id="stack1"><a href="#stack1"/>here</div> to resolve the spell on top of the stack.</div></div>
						<div style="display: block"><div id="grey4">Blossoming Defense was cast most recently, so it resolves first. Click <div id="stack2"><a href="#stack2"/>here</div> to finish resolving the stack.</div></div>
						<div id="grey5"><p>Hexproof means that a creature cannot be targeted by your opponent's spells. Since Blossoming Defense made Runeclaw Bear hexproof, Doom Blade fizzles and has no effect.</p></div>

				<p>During your turn, you can attack the other player with your creatures. During your opponent's turn, you can defend against their attack.</p>
				<p>When your opponent attacks, you can either block their attacking creatures with your creatures or you can choose to not block and subtract the damage from your life total instead.</p>
				<p>A creature's stats are shown in the bottom right corner of the card in the form "power / toughness." 
				Power is how much damage a creature deals, and toughness is how much damage a creature can take before it dies.
				For example, a creature with the stats 5 / 4 can deal 5 damage to other creatures and dies when it takes 4 damage. </p>
				<p>All damage is removed at the end of the turn so if a creature survives a turn, it will start the next turn with its full toughness.</p>

				<p>You can choose to attack on every turn, or on some turns you may decide that it is safer not to attack. 
				When a creature attacks it becomes tapped until your next turn, and tapped creatures can't block. Understanding combat is one of 
				the most important parts of Magic: The Gathering. Now you're ready to take on your first opponent!</p>
